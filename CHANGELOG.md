## [3.2.3] - 2025-06-27

### üîÑ Enhanced OpenAI API Compatibility

This release consolidates the OpenAI-compatible API endpoints and introduces intelligent auto-combine functionality.

### ‚ú® Added

- **Auto-Combine Parameter**: New optional `auto_combine` parameter in `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint (default: `true`)
- **Intelligent Text Handling**: Automatically detects long text and combines audio chunks when `auto_combine=true`
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Better error handling for long text when auto-combine is disabled
- **Response Headers**: Added `X-Auto-Combine` and `X-Chunks-Combined` headers for transparency

### üîÑ Changed

- **Unified Endpoint**: Combined `/v1/audio/speech` and `/v1/audio/speech-combined` into single endpoint
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains full OpenAI API compatibility while adding TTSFM-specific features
- **Default Behavior**: Long text is now automatically split and combined by default (can be disabled)

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **Deprecated Endpoint**: Removed `/v1/audio/speech-combined` endpoint (functionality moved to main endpoint)
- **Legacy Web Options**: Removed confusing batch processing options from web interface for cleaner UX
- **Complex UI Elements**: Simplified playground interface to focus on auto-combine

### üßπ Streamlined Web Experience

- **User-Focused Design**: Web interface now emphasizes auto-combine as the primary approach
- **Developer Features Preserved**: All advanced functionality remains in Python package
- **Clear Separation**: Web for users, Python package for developers

### üìã Migration Guide

- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing API calls continue to work unchanged
- **Long Text**: Now automatically handled by default - no need to use separate endpoint
- **Disable Auto-Combine**: Add `"auto_combine": false` to request body to get original behavior

- **Rich Metadata**: Response headers with chunk count, file size, and processing information
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks

### üîÑ Changed

- **Extended Character Limits**: No longer limited to 4096 characters per request
- **Enhanced Web Interface**: Updated documentation with combined audio endpoint information
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better validation and error messages for long text processing

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

- **Enhanced Web Interface**: Improved format selection with detailed descriptions for each format
- **Comprehensive Format Documentation**: Updated README and documentation with complete format information

### üîÑ Changed

- **File Naming Logic**: Files are now saved with extensions based on the actual returned format, not the requested format
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added format-specific log messages for better debugging
- **Web API Enhancement**: `/api/formats` endpoint now provides detailed information about all supported formats
- **Documentation Updates**: README and package documentation now include comprehensive format guides

### üêõ Fixed
